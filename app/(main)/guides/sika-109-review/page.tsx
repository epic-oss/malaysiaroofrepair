    heading: 'What Is SikaTop Seal 109 Best For?',
    content: `SikaTop Seal 109 is a substrate-layer waterproofing product — it goes on before tiling, not as a final exposed finish. It is the right product for wet areas inside a building where the waterproofing will be protected by tiles, screed, or granite.

**Best applications (where Sika 109 excels):**
• Bathroom floors and walls — the #1 use case in Malaysia; applied before all tile installations
• Shower areas — splash zone walls and floor waterproofing
• Wet kitchens — floor and wall protection against water ingress
• Swimming pools — interior pool lining; non-toxic, safe for direct water contact
• Water tanks and reservoirs — suitable for potable water (cement-based chemistry)
• Basements and below-grade structures
• Balconies and terraces — under the tile waterproofing layer
• RC gutters, planters, and car parks
• Concrete protection against carbonation and environmental attack

**Where it is not the right product:**
• Exposed roof surfaces — Sika 109 is not UV-stable for permanent exposure; use acrylic coatings (SikaFill MY, Pentens T-200) instead
• Metal substrates — designed for concrete, masonry, and cement-based surfaces only
• Cracks larger than 1mm — the 1mm crack-bridging limit applies; for larger cracks or significant movement, use Sikalastic 1K MY
• DIY beginners without waterproofing experience — the two-part mixing and surface preparation requirements mean single-component products are easier for first-time users`,

    question: 'Is Sika 109 good for bathroom waterproofing?',
    answer:
      'Yes — SikaTop Seal 109 is one of the most widely specified waterproofing products for bathrooms in Malaysia. It is specifically designed for wet areas: bathroom floors, shower areas, wet kitchens, and balconies. Apply a minimum of 2 coats on floors and 1 coat on splash-zone walls before any tiling work begins.',
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between Sika 107 and Sika 109?",
    answer:
      'Flexibility is the critical difference. Sika 109 is FLEXIBLE and can bridge cracks up to 1mm, making it ideal for bathrooms, pools, and any area where slight structural movement is expected. Sika 107 is RIGID with no crack-bridging capability — better suited for water tanks and rigid basement walls. For most Malaysian bathrooms where tile substrates always have some micro-movement, 109 is the correct choice.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much Sika 109 do I need for my bathroom?',
    answer:
      'At 1.0 kg/m² per coat with minimum 2 coats, you need 2.0 kg per sqm. A typical Malaysian bathroom (3m × 4m = 12 sqm floor + approximately 20 sqm of walls) needs around 64 kg total — nearly 2 full 36kg sets. Always purchase 2 sets to avoid running short mid-application.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use Sika 109 for roof waterproofing?',
    answer:
      'Sika 109 is not recommended for exposed roof surfaces. It is not UV-stable for long-term exposure and must be protected by screed, tiles, or granite. For exposed flat roofs, use dedicated roof coatings such as SikaFill MY (acrylic) or Sikalastic-560. For under-screed/tile roof waterproofing, Sika 109 can be used.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does SikaTop Seal 109 last?',
    answer:
      'When properly applied and protected by tiles or screed, SikaTop Seal 109 can last 10–15+ years. The key is thorough surface preparation, correct number of coats, and ensuring the coating is always covered — prolonged UV exposure will degrade unprotected cementitious coatings.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need primer before applying Sika 109?',
    answer:
      'On standard concrete substrates that are properly cleaned and dampened, no primer is needed. However, for porous surfaces such as gypsum board or lightweight concrete blocks, Sika recommends applying Sika Primer-11 WMY and allowing it to dry before applying Sika 109.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can Sika 109 be used in swimming pools?',
    answer:
      'Yes — SikaTop Seal 109 is listed for swimming pool waterproofing. It is non-toxic (cement-based chemistry) and safe for direct water contact. Apply a minimum of 2–3 coats for pool applications where water is in constant contact with the surface.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Sika 109 better than Pentens T-200?',
    answer:
      'They serve different purposes. Sika 109 is a cementitious coating designed for under-tile waterproofing in bathrooms and wet areas — excellent adhesion, flexibility, and potable water approval. Pentens T-200 is an acrylic coating designed for exposed surfaces such as flat roofs and re-waterproofing applications. For new bathroom construction, Sika 109 is the industry standard. For exposed roofs or re-coating existing surfaces, Pentens T-200 is the right tool.',

      intro={`SikaTop Seal-109 MY is one of the most specified waterproofing products in Malaysia — and for good reason. It is a two-part, polymer-modified flexible cementitious coating manufactured by Sika at their Sg. Buloh facility in Selangor, sold in a 36kg set (Part A liquid 10kg + Part B powder 26kg). Applied before tiling in bathrooms, shower areas, wet kitchens, and balconies, it creates a flexible waterproof barrier that bonds to concrete and bridges small cracks up to 1mm.

The most common question people ask is how it differs from SikaTop Seal-107. The answer is flexibility. Sika 109 is flexible, with elongation at break over 100%. Sika 107 is rigid, with no crack-bridging ability. For most Malaysian bathrooms and any tile substrate where micro-movement is expected — which is practically every installation — 109 is the product you want. This guide covers everything you need to know before buying.`}
